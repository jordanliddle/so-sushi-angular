# SpiritShop : Ongoing AngularJS project

SpiritShop is a pet project I've taken on to gain a deeper understanding of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and put into practice the various
features and tricks I've learnt since I've begun developing with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). 

Spirit shop utilizes [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), the [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.io/) companion suite and 
[Deployd](https://github.com/deployd/deployd).

SpiritShop is an ongoing project as I learn the advanced features of AngularJS. 


To see SpiritShop live, use Deployd port 5500 (dpd -p 5500 spiritshop/app.dpd) 


Thanks for checking out my work!
