# SoSushi Shop : Ongoing AngularJS project

SoSushi Shop is a pet project I've taken on to gain a deeper understanding of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and put into practice the various
features and tricks I've learnt since I've begun developing with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). 

SoSushi Shop utilizes [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), the [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.io/) companion suite and 
[Deployd](https://github.com/deployd/deployd) on the back end.

SoSushi Shop is an ongoing project as I learn the advanced features of AngularJS. 


**To see SoSushi live, use *Deployd* port 5500 (dpd -p 5500 spiritshop/app.dpd)**


Thanks for checking out my work!
